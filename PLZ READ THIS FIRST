Mods are only work in java and fabric. 
To run this mods you need to have Fabric Loader.
Fabric Loader --> https://fabricmc.net <-- Copy this link to download Fabric Loader. 
You can use any launcher like SKLAUNCHER , TLAUNCHER , FEATHER CLIENT etc.
Mods are not supported in "LUNAR CLIENT".
I prefer to use "LEGACY LAUNCHER" this launcher gives a stable "FPS" and best "PERFORMANCE".
If you have a 'LOW END PC' like me you are going to a get a best "FPS BOOST" with this mods.
